This is my first blog post on this site, and I'm excited to start writing more regularly about the things I'm working on, reading about, or just thinking throug

Hello and welcome.

## Hello

Today, I wanted to test out a few things: Markdown formatting, section headings, and support for mathematical expressions using LaTeX. It’s important to have a workflow that lets me write comfortably without constantly switching contexts between writing and rendering.

## Hello whats

One of the things I enjoy about working in mathematics is how much clarity comes from writing — even informal writing like this. It often forces ideas to solidify and reveals gaps in understanding that weren’t obvious before.

Olá, and thanks for reading. *This is a post* just to get things going, and maybe to try out some formatting.

Here’s a classic example of a quadratic formula written in display math:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

And just to check inline math rendering, here’s the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \). Hopefully, everything displays properly in your browser.

That’s all for now. More soon!
