I'm a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://kit.edu/english/) originally from [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal), under the supervision of [Manuel Krannich](https://manuelkrannich.github.io/). Previously, I studied at the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/) and the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en).
