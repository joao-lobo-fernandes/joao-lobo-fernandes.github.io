        <p>This is my first blog post on this site, and I&rsquo;m excited to start writing more regularly about the things I&rsquo;m working on, reading about, or just thinking through.</p>
<p>Hello and welcome.</p>
<h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>
<p>Today, I wanted to test out a few things: Markdown formatting, section headings, and support for mathematical expressions using LaTeX. It’s important to have a workflow that lets me write comfortably without constantly switching contexts between writing and rendering.</p>
<h2 id="hello-whats">Hello whats</h2>
<p>One of the things I enjoy about working in mathematics is how much clarity comes from writing — even informal writing like this. It often forces ideas to solidify and reveals gaps in understanding that weren’t obvious before.</p>
<p>Olá, and thanks for reading. <em>This is a post</em> just to get things going, and maybe to try out some formatting.</p>
<p>Here’s a classic example of a quadratic formula written in display math:</p>
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$<p>And just to check inline math rendering, here’s the Pythagorean theorem: ( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ). Hopefully, everything displays properly in your browser.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. More soon!</p>
